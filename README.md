## Description

Welcome to my Terraform AWS Docker repo. This image extends the
[terraform](https://github.com/hansohn/terraform-docker) image with AWS-specific
tooling, built with Terraform development and CI/CD in mind. It bundles the AWS
CLI and the AWS ruleset for TFLint on top of the base Terraform toolchain.
Tool versions are pinned in the Dockerfile and kept current through
dependency-update PRs; the image is rebuilt and published to Docker Hub weekly
(Mondays) to pick up base-image security patches.

## What's Included

This image builds on [hansohn/terraform](https://hub.docker.com/r/hansohn/terraform),
which provides:

- [terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform): Software tool that enables you to safely and predictably create, change, and improve infrastructure
- [terragrunt](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terragrunt): A thin wrapper for Terraform that provides extra tools for working with multiple Terraform modules
- [terraform-docs](https://github.com/terraform-docs/terraform-docs): Generate documentation from Terraform modules in various output formats
- [tflint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint): A Pluggable Terraform Linter
- [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy): Security scanner for your Terraform code

On top of that base, this image adds:

- [awscli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/): The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI v2)
- [tflint-ruleset-aws](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint-ruleset-aws): The AWS ruleset plugin for TFLint (pre-installed; no `tflint --init` required)

## Prerequisites

- Docker 20.10 or later
- Docker Buildx with BuildKit (required for multi-platform builds and the
  build cache mounts the Dockerfile relies on)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Pull and run the latest version
docker pull hansohn/terraform-aws:latest
docker run -it --rm hansohn/terraform-aws:latest terraform version

# Run with your Terraform code mounted
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace hansohn/terraform-aws:latest terraform plan
```

## Tags

Docker images are tagged based on the pinned version of Terraform they include
(inherited from the base image). A single Terraform version is published at a
time, and it receives the full set of tags below:

```
# tag formats (for a pinned Terraform version of e.g. 1.15.7)
hansohn/terraform-aws:latest        the currently published release
hansohn/terraform-aws:1             the 1.x.x line
hansohn/terraform-aws:1.15          the 1.15.x line
hansohn/terraform-aws:1.15.7        the exact version
```

For reproducibility, pin by digest (`hansohn/terraform-aws@sha256:...`); every
image ships provenance attestations and an SBOM bound to that digest.

## Platform Support

This image supports multiple platforms:

- `linux/amd64` (x86_64)
- `linux/arm64` (ARM64/Apple Silicon)

Docker will automatically pull the correct architecture for your system.

## Usage

Published images can be run using the following syntax:

```bash
# run latest published version
docker run -it --rm hansohn/terraform-aws:latest /bin/bash
```

Local images can be built and run using the following syntax:

```bash
# build and run local image
make
```

Additionally, a Makefile has been included in this repo to assist with common
development-related functions. I've included the following make targets for
convenience:

```
Available targets:

  clean                               Clean everything
  dev                                 Initialize development environment
  docker/build                        Docker build image
  docker/check                        Check if Docker daemon is running
  docker/clean                        Docker clean build images
  docker/lint                         Lint Dockerfile
  docker/push                         Docker push image
  docker/run                          Docker run image
  help                                Help screen
  help/all                            Display help for all targets
  help/short                          This help short screen
```

## Examples

### Initialize Terraform

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace \
  hansohn/terraform-aws:latest terraform init
```

### Run the AWS CLI

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $HOME/.aws:/root/.aws \
  hansohn/terraform-aws:latest aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### Lint with the AWS ruleset

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/src -w /src \
  hansohn/terraform-aws:latest tflint
```

### Generate Documentation

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/docs -w /docs \
  hansohn/terraform-aws:latest terraform-docs markdown . > README.md
```

### Run Security Scan

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/src -w /src \
  hansohn/terraform-aws:latest trivy config .
```

## Customization

### Utilities

Utility versions are pinned in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) and kept current
through automated dependency-update PRs. For a local build you can override any
of them on the command line to target a specific version:

- TERRAFORM_VERSION (selects the base `hansohn/terraform` image tag)
- TFLINT_AWS_VERSION
- AWSCLI_VERSION

```bash
# build against a specific AWS CLI version
AWSCLI_VERSION=2.35.0 make docker/build
```

> **Note:** Builds require BuildKit (the default in modern Docker). The Dockerfile
> uses BuildKit cache mounts, so `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` is not supported.

## Build & Refresh Schedule

Images are automatically:

- **Built and linted** on every push (multi-platform, without publishing)
- **Published** when a version tag is pushed
- **Refreshed** every Monday at 7am UTC to pick up the latest base-image security patches

This ensures published images stay up-to-date with the latest base image security updates.

## Security

- Images include provenance attestations and SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)
- The AWS CLI installer is PGP-verified and the TFLint AWS ruleset is checksum-verified at build time
- Published images are scanned for vulnerabilities with Trivy
- Security vulnerabilities? See our [Security Policy](.github/SECURITY.md)
