# than "latest" it is echoed back unchanged (pinned versions pass through).
# Otherwise the latest release is looked up via the tool's release API and
# cached in ${CACHE_DIR} for one hour so repeated builds don't hammer the API.
#
# Only the AWS-specific tooling layered on top of the base terraform image is
# handled here; the base image resolves its own tool versions at build time.
